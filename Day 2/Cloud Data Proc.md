# Day 2
`open source bigdata system`

## Universal Second Factor
*   Users can also use second factors when signing in, including devices based on the `universal second factor` U2F open standard

*   Google services that want to make themselves available on the Internet register themselves with an infrastructure service called the       Google Front End


## Google Front End

* # It checks incoming network connections for correct certificates and best practices. The GFE also additionally, applies protections         against denial of service attacks. The sheer scale of its infrastructure, enables Google to simply absorb many denial of service attacks,   even behind the GFEs. Google also has multi-tier, multi-layer denial of service protections that further reduce the risk of any denial of   service impact


## Red Team Exercises

*   Google also uses Red Team exercises, simulated attacks to improve the effectiveness of its responses.

*   Google stores its source code centrally and requires two-party review of new code. Google also gives its developers libraries that keep     them from introducing certain classes of security bugs
