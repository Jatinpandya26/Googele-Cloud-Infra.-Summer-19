   ## Identity and Access Management [IAM]

* IAM lets administrators authorize who can take action on specific resources. An IAM policy has a "who" part, a "can do what" part, and an "on which resource" part. 

## Who part

* The "who" part names the user or users you're talking about. The "who" part of an IAM policy can be defined either by a Google account, a Google group, a Service account, an entire G Suite, or a Cloud Identity domain. 

## Can Do Part

* The "can do what" part is defined by an IAM role. An IAM role is a collection of permissions. Most of the time, to do any meaningful operations, you need more than one permission


## Example 

* For example, to manage instances in a project, you need to create, delete, start, stop, and change an instance. So the permissions are grouped together into a role that makes them easier to manage
